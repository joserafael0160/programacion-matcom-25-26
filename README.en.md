## 📜 About
Hello, I'm **José Rafael** (C-122) 👋.

This repository contains the **exercises and my solutions** from the practical classes I receive at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computing ([MATCOM](https://github.com/matcom)) of the University of Havana (UH) 2025 - 2026 course. 

As a first-year student, my goal is to share valuable educational resources that can help other students better understand the concepts and techniques taught in our classes 🎓.

## 📚 Content
- [**Exercises and Solutions**](#-practical-classes): A collection of practical exercises along with their detailed solutions. These exercises cover a variety of topics that are taught in the first year of the Computer Science degree.
- Projects: Larger, more complex projects that are developed throughout the course. These projects are designed to apply the knowledge gained in more realistic and challenging situations.
- Additional Resources: Supplementary material such as articles, tutorials, and links to online resources that may be helpful for delving deeper into the topics covered in class.

## 🧰 Technologies
- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) – A high-level, interpreted, multi-paradigm programming language widely used in data science, web development, automation, artificial intelligence, and algorithm education. Its clean syntax and vast ecosystem make it ideal for learning and building robust solutions.
- [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A powerful, lightweight code editor developed by Microsoft, offering a rich set of features for coding, debugging, and version control, making it ideal for modern software and web app development.
